Technology has many great upsides. From powerful information sharing capabilities to awesome graphics, the possibilities for helping others is vast.

My issue with technology has been consuming. I was not alive before the creation of the internet, but even my childhood it was not as bad as it is today. It started off with cartoons on tv, which was quick entertainment, but you still had to be in front of the tv and make time for it.

Around 2012 I started watching Youtube videos, mainly from an Ipad. This meant that anywhere I went I could bring the Ipad and just watch Youtube videos. It got so easy that I would not even turn on the tv anymore. This easy dopamine fix leads people to not get dopamine from other places, which could bring so much more to their lives. If I didn't put all those countless hours into watching Youtube videos and scrolling on Instagram, where would I be?
#### Pain.
It pains me to think about all the time I lost just because of nonsense online video platforms that were designed like slot machines to deplete me from all my precious brain juices. All my ambitions stop like a car driving into a wall when I pick up that stupid phone and turn on a silly app where I see a monkey do a backflip and say *"Hah thats funny"*, only to forget it in the next 10 minutes.

Now, I'm not saying that its not my fault, because yeah it is. I choose to pick up my phone in the morning, I choose to click on the social media app, I choose to keep scrolling even after I **know** I've been at it for hours. It is all my choice.
#### What is the solution?
Yesterday I was watching a Youtube video (yeah I know, how ironic) where someone was talking about how to overcome this perpetual machine of consuming. They were talking about how it is always about willpower, habits and other shenanigans like dopamine detoxes that will fix you right up. But they've never worked for me, which the video also confirmed not to be helpful. Their advice was, to whenever I think of consuming or opening an app, I go straight to **creating**. This means that instead of getting my dopamine fix from easy videos, I have to get it out of doing something productive, or just something I enjoy doing that doesn't consume someone else's creations. I have to be the creator, not the consumer.
